This spreadsheet contains all of my recorded entries highlighted in yellow. I tracked membership revenue, personal training income, and payments received, along with expenses such as equipment purchases, maintenance, utilities, and marketing. I posted journal entries, maintained the general ledger, and created the trial balance by determining the correct debits and credits. This exercise strengthened my understanding of real-world accounting and allowed me to prepare a profit and loss statement. Please also note the use of “IF” functions within the trial balance to check accuracy and balances.
